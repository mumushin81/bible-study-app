## How to Complete Remaining Verses

### Option 1: Manual Generation (Recommended for Quality)
Use the existing pattern from completed verses:

```bash
# 1. Copy a template from existing verse
cp data/genesis-7-1-content.json data/genesis-7-2-content.json

# 2. Edit the file with appropriate content for verse 2

# 3. Upload to Supabase
npx tsx scripts/saveVerseContent.ts data/genesis-7-2-content.json --force
```

### Option 2: Use Generation Script
The `generateVersePrompt.ts` script can help:

```bash
# Generate prompt for multiple verses
npx tsx scripts/generateVersePrompt.ts genesis_7_2,genesis_7_3,genesis_7_5

# Copy the generated prompt and use Claude to create content
```

### Option 3: Batch Generation with AI
Use the existing 5 verses as examples and ask Claude to generate the remaining verses in batches of 5-10.
